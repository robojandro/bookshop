A toy backend for a store that will never exist.

<a name="Motivation"></a>

## Motivation
Tens of thousands of lines of code I've written over the years in Golang, Perl, and Javascript might as well not exist since it's almost completely locked away behind the private repos of my former employers. That doesn't really do me any good as in communicating with potential employers.

So why not write a mythical backend, if for nothing else, than to show that I can code and chew bubblegum at the same time.

## Goals
Let's show how to do an onion architecture backend.

TODO:

- [ ] persistant db store and tests
  - [x] books
  - [ ] authors
- [ ] service layer with business logic and tests
- [ ] http REST server and tests
